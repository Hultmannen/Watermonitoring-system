# Watermonitoring-system
Hardware Components:
ESP32 Microcontroller: Low-cost, Wi-Fi capable board ideal for IoT and real-time data 
applications. 
Laptop: Portable and sufficient to power the system for hours. 
SD Card Module and SD Card: For reliable local storage of sensor data. 
Sensors: 
1. pH Sensor (v1.1): Measures acidity/alkalinity. 
2. Turbidity Sensor (TTS analog): Measures water clarity. 
3. Temperature Sensor (DS18B20): Records temperature in degrees Celsius. 
4. TDS Sensor (Keystudio v1.0): Measures dissolved minerals and salts.
5. Any plastic container that you can adapt to fit all the sensors and microcontrollers on. ps You will have to make it float.

Alternatives to the ESP32, including the Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno, were 
evaluated during the preliminary phases of the project. The Raspberry Pi was deemed 
excessively resource-intensive with respect to power consumption and software 
complexity, thereby rendering it less suitable for field deployment. Although the 
Arduino Uno is economically viable, it lacks integrated Wi-Fi, which imposes 
limitations on connectivity options. The ESP32 was selected due to its potential for 
future applications because of its low power consumption, built-in Wi-Fi functionality, 
comprehensive documentation, and compatibility with a diverse array of sensors. 

Software Tools:
Arduino IDE: Used for coding, uploading, and debugging the ESP32 firmware.
